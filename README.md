## Project Overview
The *AI-Powered Climate Stress Test* is a system designed to identify and visualize vulnerabilities in global supply chains caused by climate events. It enables decision-makers to forecast risks, estimate potential disruptions, and design resilient strategies to strengthen supply chain operations.

---

## Problem Statement
Global supply chains are increasingly exposed to climate-related risks such as extreme weather events, floods, and heatwaves. Traditional risk assessment methods are largely reactive, making it difficult for companies to anticipate disruptions. This project provides a *data-driven approach* to forecast climate risks and evaluate their impact on supply chain operations.

## Features
- *Climate Data Analysis:* Process and analyze temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather events data.
- *Supply Chain Mapping:* Visualize suppliers, locations, transport routes, and facility nodes.
- *Risk Scoring:* Calculate comprehensive risk scores for suppliers and routes.
- *Machine Learning Predictions:* Apply AI/ML models to predict disruption probabilities.
- *Scenario Modeling:* Perform "what-if" analyses for various climate scenarios.
- *Interactive Visualizations:* Generate heatmaps, time-series trends, and network graphs.
- *Risk Mitigation Recommendations:* Provide actionable insights for supply chain resilience.

## Data Sources
The system works with multiple datasets:  

*Recommended Real Datasets*
- Climate Data:
  - [Berkeley Earth Global Surface Temperatures (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)
  - [NOAA GHCN Daily Station Data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily)
- Supply Chain Data:
  - DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset
  - Comprehensive supply-chain datasets from Kaggle
- Risk Index Data:
  - [ND-GAIN Country Index](https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/)

*Demo Data*
- climate_data.csv: Sample climate time-series data
- supply_chain_data.csv: Sample supplier and logistics data
- risk_index_data.csv: Sample risk vulnerability scores

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Load and clean CSV datasets using *Pandas*.
- Handle missing values and normalize data.
- Merge climate, supply chain, and risk index data.

### AI/ML Analysis
- Apply regression/classification models to predict disruption probability.
- Use *K-Means clustering* to identify high-risk supplier regions.
- Run scenario modeling for different climate events.

### Visualization
- Create static visualizations using *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn*.
- Build interactive dashboards with *Plotly*.
- Generate supply chain network graphs with *NetworkX*.
